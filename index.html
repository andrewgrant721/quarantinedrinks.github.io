          <p>The project I was assigned was to create a fake business and make a responsive web design using the flex-box method. I was looking up some inspiration, but in the end I went with something that felt fun and current. I have been trying not to drink as much anymore, but in the beginning of this quarantine journey there were a lot of fun cocktails made. Here are just a few!</p>

              <h4>Bloody Maria</h4>
              <p>Let's start off by adding a twist to classic. It's basically a regular Bloody Mary, but with tequila instead. It wasnt the greatest drink, but it was something.</p>

              <h4>California Lemonade</h4>
              <p>This one kicked my booty. It is whiskey with lemon juice and club soda, but I was out of club soda so we used an alchohlic seltzer...</p>

              <h4>Old Fashioned</h4>
              <p>A classic. Can you tell that I was running low on other liquors? All we had in the house was whiskey.</p>

              <h4>Horse Feather</h4>
              <p>This one is basically a mule, but instead of vodka... you guessed it. Whiskey.</p>

              <h4>Quaren-tini</h4>
              <p>I added this one in here because the name was so stinking adorable. It's exactly the same as a regular martini, but it is exclusive to this time period.</p>
